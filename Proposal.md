# Solution for improving the utility of funds raised from donors and the public.

## Description 

This proposal aims to improve the utility of funds raised from donors and the public. First, we need to promote the credibility of UBI distribution, ensuring that the funds are delivered to those who are really in need of help. Second, we should assign community managers and reward them according to their contribution during the post. Third, we can optimze the treasury with models and protocols to appreciate the funds so that more people could be covered.

## Scope

### Promoting the credibility of UBI distribution

According to the present documentation of ImpactMarket, community managers have two kinds of power: first, they can submit the community for approval and manage all the community's beneficiaries; second, they can also add Other managers to a community at their own discretion. However, this power can be abused, which may result in an issue that a manager may drag in a beneficiary to get more funds from the DAO and then remove him/her right after getting access to the funds. Here are also some poverty elimination projects in China but nearly all of them failed because of corruption. I believe that it is also necessary for ImpactMarket to prevent abuses of power. This can be achieved by setting up a lock-down mechanism, that we regulate a period, for example, a week, before the end of which the managers can not remove any beneficiaries. Plus, we need also limit the number of beneficiaries that one manager is allowed to add in a certain length of time, for example, 24 hours.

### Assigning and rewarding community managers according to their contribution

In 1988, Robert Klitgaard proposed a famous formula to describe the factors of corruption: 

$C = M + D + A$
